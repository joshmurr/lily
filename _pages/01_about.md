With the visual arts at the core of everything I do, my work spans a number of roles including curation, art direction, production and journalism. 

I have been lucky enough to contribute to organisations such as Tate Gallery, i-D Magazine, AnOther Magazine, Huck Magazine and Dazed & Confused Magazine. I am also one of the founders of Brainchild, an independent multi-arts festival.
