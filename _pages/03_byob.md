<p>Sophie Rogers, Hannah Gill and I, are hosted a BYOB exhibition in March 2016. BYOB stands for Bring Your Own Beamer, as artists are invited to bring projectors (beamers) and show their work in a space. It's an open source project, which was founded by RafaÃ«l Rozendaal in 2010. Anyone can host one, and it's almost entirely free. As a result, it has become a cult favourite with digital artists from Tokyo to Bogota and everywhere in between.</p>

<p>We were very excited by the possibilities of this idea. It encourages a universal celebration of creativity, giving people a platform outside of major institutions. While we aim to do this with Brainchild, BYOB succeeds on a global scale. So, we posted an open invite to our network and found a number of inspiring video artists to exhibit.</p>

<p>As a homage to the early dons of net.art and post-internet artists worldwide, Sophie, Hannah and I, selected from the submissions around 20 tech-happy, synthetic commentaries on our digital era. This show was all about bright colours, animations and computer rendered alien bodies. Each filmmaker looks into the beautiful, false reality of our digital world and dives right in, often imposing their own hand on the software to create something human despite it being coded in CMYK.</p>


<p>Featured artists: Josie Tucker, Ting Jumper, Sophie Rogers, Hannah Gill, Joe Melhuish, Scott Carthy, Amy Webster, Dan Adeyemi, Jonathan Harris, Matilda Skelton Mace, Sapphire Goss, Hattie Ball, Loup Blaster, Georgina Brinkman, Matt Gee, Laure Rees-Smith, Joana Palma, Jack Addis, Alice Dunseath, Vasilisa Forbes, Eva Papamargariti and Matteo Zamagni.</p>
